## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd facial-emotion-recognition-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Model Integration

The application includes a mock emotion analysis function that you can replace with your actual deep learning model. Here are the integration options:

### Option 1: TensorFlow.js (Client-side)
```typescript
import * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';

export const analyzeEmotion = async (imageData: string): Promise<EmotionData[]> => {
  // Load your pre-trained model
  const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('/path/to/your/model.json');
  
  // Preprocess image
  const tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(imageElement)
    .resizeNearestNeighbor([224, 224])
    .expandDims(0)
    .div(255.0);
  
  // Run inference
  const predictions = await model.predict(tensor) as tf.Tensor;
  const results = await predictions.data();
  
  // Format results
  return formatEmotionResults(results);
};
```

### Option 2: API Integration (Server-side)
```typescript
export const analyzeEmotion = async (imageData: string): Promise<EmotionData[]> => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/analyze-emotion', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ image: imageData }),
  });
  
  const results = await response.json();
  return results.emotions;
};
```

### Option 3: Cloud Services
```typescript
// Example with AWS Rekognition
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';

const rekognition = new AWS.Rekognition();

export const analyzeEmotion = async (imageData: string): Promise<EmotionData[]> => {
  const params = {
    Image: {
      Bytes: Buffer.from(imageData.split(',')[1], 'base64')
    },
    Attributes: ['ALL']
  };
  
  const result = await rekognition.detectFaces(params).promise();
  return formatRekognitionResults(result);
};
```

## 🎨 Emotion Categories

The system recognizes the following emotions:

- **Happy** 😊 - Green (#10B981)
- **Sad** 😢 - Blue (#3B82F6)
- **Angry** 😠 - Red (#EF4444)
- **Surprised** 😲 - Orange (#F59E0B)
- **Neutral** 😐 - Gray (#6B7280)
- **Fear** 😨 - Purple (#8B5CF6)
- **Disgust** 🤢 - Pink (#EC4899)

## 🏠 Smart Device Automation

The system automatically adjusts connected devices based on detected emotions:

- **Happy**: Bright warm lighting (90% brightness, golden yellow) + upbeat music
- **Sad**: Soft blue lighting (40% brightness) + calming piano music
- **Angry**: Gentle lighting (60% brightness, soft red) + meditation sounds
- **Fear**: Warm dim lighting (30% brightness, purple) + peaceful nature sounds
- **Surprised**: Bright energetic lighting (80% brightness, orange) + instrumental music
- **Neutral**: Balanced lighting (60% brightness, alice blue) + ambient background

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: Camera data is processed locally in the browser
- **No Data Storage**: Images are not stored or transmitted unless explicitly configured
- **Anonymous Reporting**: Bias reports are collected anonymously for model improvement
- **Secure Connections**: All API calls use HTTPS
- **Permission-based**: Camera access requires explicit user permission
- **User Consent**: All data collection requires explicit user consent

## 📱 Browser Compatibility
